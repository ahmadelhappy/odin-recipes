  <H2>Description</H2>
  <p>This steak marinade is a family recipe that has been developed only over the last 5 years. In this short time, it's made me famous in our close circle, but until now I've never shared it with anyone.</p>
  <p>Why Marinate a Steak?</p>
  <p>Marinating a steak before cooking serves two purposes: It helps tenderize the meat and adds just the right amount of flavor. Some top-quality steaks can go without a marinade, since they're already full of meaty flavor and, with the right prep, end up juicy and tender without any help from a marinade. Budget-friendly steaks, however, benefit tremendously from marination. You'll be shocked at the difference a good marinade makes!</p>
